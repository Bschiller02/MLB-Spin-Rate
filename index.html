      <p>If you were to ask a Major League Baseball fan from the 1960s what method they would use to project a pitcher’s success in the big leagues, they would say they would look at a pitcher’s earned run average. Now, baseball fanatics, athletes, and front-office personnel are now turning to spin rate to get a closer look at the potential behind a pitcher.</p>
      <p>Spin rate is a method of data collection of how many “spins” a ball took when thrown.</p>
      <p>“When you talk to Major League hitters, they tell you that the higher the spin rate is, the more likely you're not to be able to see the ball. It's more of a blur, the ball,” said Ryan Hooper, associate professor of Physics at Lewis University and baseball physicist.</p>
      <p>There are three different types of spin that pitchers and coaches examine to help develop pitchers for higher level baseball.</p>
      <p>"Backspin is most common in four-seam fastballs,” said Brandon Smith, a Sports Management researcher at St. John Fisher College. “As the ball is released from the pitcher's hand the ball is back spinning, and has the illusion that the ball is riding (or carrying).”</p>
      <p>Stop spin is most likely found in breaking ball pitches, like curveballs. Smith added, “top spin is the opposite of backspin in the sense that you should visualize the baseball spinning end over end upon release from a pitcher's hands.”</p>
      <p>Unlike curveballs, sliders have a different type of spin because of its ability to move horizontally.  Transversepin, or sidespin, has one the highest levels of rpms because of its efficiency when thrown against gravity.</p>
      <p>Understanding the philosophy behind spin rate is crucial for pitching develop among high school prospects and even journeymen pitchers in professional baseball. Several pitchers, since the advancement of technology and understanding in baseball, have seen success when their careers in doubt.</p>
      <p>Usually when a pitcher reaches 39 years of age, they are out of the league. But, Justin Verlander, is defying age and odds after returning from Tommy John Surgery. Today, Verlander carries a 1.93 ERA, one of the best earned run averages in the league this season.</p> 
      <P>Verlander’s fastball is contributing to his success at such an old age for a professional athlete. While Verlander’s fastball rpm has dropped nearly 100 points since his dominant 2019 season, his fastball spin still ranks at 2,397 rpm, which is 98% effective on the MLB spectrum.</P>

      <p>Relying on other pitches than fastballs has revived many pitcher’s careers, like Yu Darvish’s. Since spin rate was closely examined in the late 2010s, there has been a trend of less fastballs being thrown at the major league level.</p> 
      <p>Now, Darvish only throws his fastball 40% of the time, and not nearly 60% of the time before the 2019 season begun. Darvish had nearly a 5.00 ERA in 2018, but after studying his spin rate trends, he had a 2.01 ERA in 2020 and placed second in CY Young Award voting.</p> 
      <p>In 2015, pitchers threw fastballs, on average, 57% of the time. In the first month of regular season in 2022, fastballs are being thrown now 48% of the time.</p>

      <p>Pitchers used to focus on velocity with their fastball to get hitters out, but now spin rate and pitch movement have excelled the conversation to focus on the pitches’ blur. Pitching coaches now rather have a pitcher with fastball movement than a fastball that hits 98 miles per hour on the radar gun.</p> 
      <p>Smith said that pitchers now have a better understanding on their breaking pitches and are adding it to their pitching arsenal. If a pitcher has an effective breaking pitch or slider, they are now more likely to use it when there is two strikes in a count or if they need to get the batter out immediately, Smith added.</p> 
      <p>Development and alterations to pitching mechanics is also a huge contributor to the success of these pitchers, according to Hooper.</p>
      <p>“So in my experience, there's some hand mechanics that go into (an increase in spin rate from a pitcher), as well as, the flexibility of the fingers,” said Hooper. “I also have a hypothesis that the overall geometry of a pitcher's hand has something to do with this.”</p> 
      <p>Hooper added that the use of sticky substances helps a pitcher grip the ball differently. But, ever since the foreign substance use crackdown during the 2021 season, pitchers need to now figure out how to grip the ball differently if they are having a lack of success in the big leagues.</p> 
      <p>With the advancements in technology, spin rate will continue to be an indicator of a pitcher’s potential success in the big leagues.</p>
